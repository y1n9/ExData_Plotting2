# data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. 
# For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year.
#       fips: A five-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county
#       SCC: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string (see source code classification table)
#       Pollutant: A string indicating the pollutant
#       Emissions: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons
#       type: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)
#       year: The year of emissions recorded
